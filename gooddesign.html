		   Value of Good Design
       </h1>
       <p>
            Even a resting space in the Museum of Modern Art in New York feels like a modern art piece. It makes people naturally appreciate art even if they just relax. There was an exhibition called the value of good design on the third floor. I thought this exhibition would reveal the characteristics of MoMa, who always thought about how good design affects our lives. Various products such as cute piat cars, werra cameras and Japanese sewing machines were on display. The first models of good designed objects perhaps know we see it as more common designs such as chairs and kitchenware were on display, which was interesting. If the Metropolitan Museum of Art shows artworks of humans from ancient to modern times, Moma is showing artworks of modern human-beings. The phrases that define various concepts of good design that can be somewhat abstract and subjective were also quite impressive.
