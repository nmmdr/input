       <h1>New Moma</h1>
       <p>"The new system employs prominent use of the MoMa logo as a graphic deice, dramatic cropping and juxtapositions of artwork, and a brighter color palette to create a bold, contemporary image." - Pentagram

      After four months of internal construction, the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in New York (MoMA, below) unveiled a new look. MoMA, which has established New York as the center of modern art since 1929, has carried out sweeping reconstruction to continue its role in the future. The renovation, which cost $450 million, has expanded its original size by 30 percent. With more than 1,000 works.
      Moreover, the change to challenging branding design, which has completely transformed itself from the previous monotonous branding, is showing innovative and enterprising colors to match modern art galleries. Luckily, I had a chance to listen to a lecture by the design team that took charge of Moma's new branding at school, and I was very happy to hear the details of the process from the beginning of the rebranding idea to its completion.
